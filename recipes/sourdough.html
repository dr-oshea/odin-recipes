        <img src="../images/sourdough.jpg" width="350" alt="Image of Daniel's sourdough bread">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is for Daniel's standard approach to baking sourdough bread!</p>
        <p>It requires a maintained active sourdough starter, and a couple of days work!</p>
        <p> This recipe makes two round loaves though ingredients may be halved for a single loaf.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sourdough starter (xxx g)</li>
            <li>Flour (xxx g)</li>
            <li>Salt (xxx g)</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Replenish Starter</h4></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove starter from fridge two nights before final loaf is to be baked</li>
                <li>Empty starter jar to <strong>630g</strong> (mass includes jar)</li>
                <li>Replenish with <strong>100g</strong> of wholemeal flour and <strong>100g</strong> of tepid-warm water</li>
                <li>Stir to combine. Leave at room teperature overnight, it should hopefully close to double in volume</li>
            </ol>
            <li><h4>Create Levain</h4></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Add xx g of active starter to a new container</li>
                <li>Add xx g of whole meal flour and xx g of white flour</li>
                <li>Add xx g of tepid-warm water</li>
                <li>Stir to fully combine</li>
                <li>Leave levain in a sunny spot for 4 hours and 45 minutes</li>
                <li><em>Replenish Starter according to Stage 1 and return to fridge until next bake</em></li>
            </ol>
            <li><h4>Mix Dough</h4></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Set a large bowl on a scale and zero the scale</li>
                <li>Add all the levain to the bowl. Zero the scale</li>
                <li>Add <strong>600g</strong> of tepid-warm water to the bowl</li>
                <li>Mix the levain and water to fully dissolve</li>
                <li>Add <strong>250g</strong> of wholemeal flour and <strong>900g</strong> of white flour</li>
                <li>Mix to combine and hydrate mix completely</li>
                <li>Cover with a damp teatowel and leave for 20 minutes to autolyse</li>
            </ol>
            <li><h4>Knead</h4></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Add <strong>20g</strong> of plain salt</li>
                <li>Add a dash of water if needed then mix the salt into the dough</li>
                <li>Empty the dough out onto a clean bench</li>
                <li>Knead the dough using the slap and fold approach for 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Return to bowl, cover with a damp teatowel and encase in a plastic bag</li>
            </ol>
            <li><h4>Bulk Fermentation</h4></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Leave the bowl in a sunny position. The bulk fermentation will take 4 hours in total</li>
                <li>After each hour (4 times total) complete a stretch and fold</li>
                <li>Lift one end of the dough with both hands, allow to sag and stretch under gravity, then tuck back in under itself</li>
                <li>rotate 90 degrees and repeat, until back to the original position</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl until the next hour</li>
            </ol>
            <li><h4>Shaping</h4></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer the dough onto a clean surface being careful not to deflate any gas</li>
                <li>Cut the dough into two equal pieces using a dough scraper</li>
                <li>For each dough, gently pull corners of the dough out (stretch) then press into the centre</li>
                <li>Repeat around the dough until a tight ball begins to form</li>
                <li>Flip the dough and using a scraper gently roll the edges of the dough to create tension</li>
                <li>Cover with damp teatowel for 20 minutes to relax</li>
                <li>Repeat Steps 2-4</li>
                <li>Heavily coat two round banneton with rice flour</li>
                <li>Gently place each shaped dough into a banneton seam side down (upside down)</li>
                <li>Cover in plastic bag and place in the fridge for second retarded fermentation, until time to bake</li>
            </ol>
            <li><h4>Scoring and Baking<h4></li>
            <ol>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>Note, after Stage 2, a 'floating test' may be performed to assess the rediness of the levain to produce a successful sourdough:</p>
